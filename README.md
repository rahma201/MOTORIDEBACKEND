# MOTRIDEBACKEND
This project is a backend web API that contains endpoints for two types of users: **Users** and **Admins**. The API allows users to browse motorcycles, purchase bikes, book maintenance services, and explore related gear such as clothing and protective equipment. The admin endpoints allow admins to manage all content and operations available to users.
